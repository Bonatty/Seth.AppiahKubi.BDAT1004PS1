    "#If the word starts with a consonant, move that letter to the end and append 'ay'.\n",
    "#For example, 'happy' becomes 'appyhay' and 'pencil' becomes 'encilpay'.\n",

For our purposes, there are 5 vowels: a, e, i, o, u (so we count y as a consonant). Write a function pig() that takes a word (i.e., a string) as input and returns its pigLatin form. Your function should still work if the input word contains upper case characters. Your output should always be lower case however.\n",
